## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Tip #1: Start Simple**
Don't max everything out! Begin with:
- Complexity: 3-5
- Mutation: 10-15%
- Let it evolve 10+ generations

### **Tip #2: Use Environments**
Each environment teaches different styles:
- Learn Ambient first (forgiving)
- Try Jazz for complexity
- Experimental for surprises

### **Tip #3: Guide Evolution**
The Like/Skip buttons are powerful:
- Like = "More of this trait"
- Skip = "Less of this trait"
- Use them every few generations

### **Tip #4: Layer Mixing**
Click the layer toggles:
- 🎹 Melody
- 🎸 Bass
- 🎼 Chords

Solo them to understand composition!

### **Tip #5: Save Everything**
Storage is unlimited:
- Save whenever you hear something good
- Export as backup
- Build a library

## 🐛 Quick Fixes

### No Sound?
1. Click anywhere on page
2. Check system volume
3. Try different browser

### Too Chaotic?
1. Lower mutation rate
2. Increase generations
3. Press Reset

### Too Boring?
1. Raise mutation rate
2. Try Experimental
3. Use Skip button more

### Slow Performance?
1. Close other tabs
2. Reduce complexity
3. Refresh page

## 📊 Understanding Fitness

Your genome has 3 fitness scores:

**Melodic Interest** (How interesting is the melody?)
- Low = boring, repetitive
- High = varied, engaging

**Harmonic Consonance** (How pleasant is the harmony?)
- Low = dissonant, clashing
- High = consonant, smooth

**Rhythmic Stability** (How solid is the rhythm?)
- Low = chaotic, random
- High = steady, grooving

**Overall Fitness** = Combined score
- Try to reach 0.75+
- 0.85+ is excellent!
